        <h3>Our story</h3>
        <p>
          The Italian Itinerary started after a trip where we tried to do everything and came home exhausted. We went back, slowed down, and wrote better notes. Those notes turned into clear routes that keep the bright fun parts and soften the heavy parts.
        </p>

        <h3>Who we plan for</h3>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Ava Bowman and I lived in Italy for a year and a half. I spent time in Milano, Livorno, Bologna and other cities, and I fell in love with everyday Italian life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to create the ultimate travel guide website to my favorite places to eat, see, shop and experience the Italian culture. During those 18 months I never once drove a car! I took trains, buses, bikes and walked everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love Italy and all it has to offer, so do not wait, book the plane ticket!
